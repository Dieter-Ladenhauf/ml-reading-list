# Machine learning reading list
My personal reading list for machine learning resources which I stumpled upon. While I'm listing the items primarily for myself, others might also be interested.

## General information

### Blog posts

- [x] [ML@B](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/): Machine learning crash course - Part 1 *(by Daniel Geng and Shannon Shih)*
  - https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2016/11/06/tutorial-1/
  - Explains the basics of supervised learning. Classification vs. regression, decision boundary, predictor, cost function (MSE), gradient descent 
  - :star::star::star::star::star: *Very good introduction to machine learning.*

- [x] [ML@B](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/): Machine learning crash course - Part 2 *(by Daniel Geng and Shannon Shih)*
  - https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2016/12/24/tutorial-2/
  - Difference supervised and unsupervised learning, perceptron algorithm, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs)
  - :star::star::star::star::star: *Hillarious blog post explaining the concept of the perceptron algorithm with the number of people taking showers in Hong Kong as input.*
